The following trace files are not included due to large sizes:  
	-    train/densenet121_cpu_train.trace   
	-    train/maml_cpu_train.trace  
	-    train/resnet50_cpu_train.trace  
	-    train/resnext50_32x4d_cpu_train.trace   
	

SETUP  
pytorch/benchmark: master(commit: c0c4d9d).  
torch+torchtext+torchvision: pytorchnightly.  

Cmd: `taskset -c 23 python test_profiled.py`  

FILES:  
Use the profiling files for trainning as a example:  
Profile cmds:  
```
    with torch.autograd.profiler.profile(with_stack=True, record_shapes=True) as prof:
        m.train()
    print(prof.key_averages().table(sort_by='self_cpu_time_total'))
    prof.export_chrome_trace(basepath+m.name+"_"+device+"_train.trace")
```
1. The `print` stmt prints the list of operations sorted by self cpu time, which corresponds to FILE *{benchmarkname}_cpu_train.tab*

2. `prof.export_chrome_trace(...)` prints the chrome trace event list, i.e., FILE *{benchmarkname}_cpu_train.trace*

    using which file I extraced the hot aten operation patterns:
    1) FILE *{tracefile}_op_patterns_by_calls_K*: a list of all aten operation patterns of size K sorted by number of calls
    2) FILE *{tracefile}_op_patterns_by_time_K*: a list of all aten operation patterns of size K sorted by self cpu total time
    3) FILE *{tracefile}_communities_by_calls*: a list of aten operation groups(communities) generated by performing community detection on the network of the aten operations while edge weight being the number of appearance of the two connected operations as a pair in the trace
    4) FILE *{tracefile}_communities_by_time*: a list of aten operation groups(communities) generated by performing community detection on the network of the aten operations while edge weight being self cpu total time of the two connected operations as a pair
